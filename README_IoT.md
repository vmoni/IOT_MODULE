## ⚙️ Components of IoT

| 🔸 Component | 🧩 Function | 🧠 Description |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Sensor** 🛰️ | Data Collection | Collects data from the environment (e.g., temperature, light, humidity). |
| **Microcontroller (Controller)** 💻 | Processing & Control | Takes input from sensors, processes it, and generates output to manage a task or device. |
| **Actuator** ⚡ | Action Execution | Performs actions based on commands (e.g., turning ON a fan, moving a motor). |
| **Connectivity** 🌐 | Communication | Enables IoT devices to communicate with one another, with gateways, and with cloud platforms. |
| **Cloud Platform** ☁️ | Storage & Analysis | Collects, stores, manages, and analyzes IoT data for insights and automation. |
| **User Interface** 📱 | Monitoring & Control | Allows users to monitor and control devices remotely. |

## ☁️ Cloud Concepts in IoT

| 🔹 Term | 📘 Description |
|---------|----------------|
| **Cloud Protocols** 🔐 | Rules that enable IoT devices and systems to communicate, share data, and ensure interoperability. Provide features like security, connectivity, and device discovery. |
| **Cloud Platform** ☁️ | Internet-based service used for large-scale data collection, management, analytics, and visualization. Examples: AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub, Google Cloud IoT. |

## ☁️ Cloud Protocols in IoT 🔐

### 📘 Definition
Cloud protocols are **communication rules and standards** that allow IoT devices, gateways, and cloud platforms to exchange data reliably and securely.  
They define **how messages are formatted, transmitted, and acknowledged** between devices and servers.

IoT devices use lightweight and efficient protocols suitable for **low-power** and **low-bandwidth** environments.

### 🔸 Types of Cloud Communication Protocols

| 🌐 Protocol | ⚙️ Full Form | 🧠 Working Principle | 💡 Key Features | 📍 Typical Use |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **MQTT** | *Message Queuing Telemetry Transport* | Follows **Publish/Subscribe model** — devices publish data to a topic; subscribers receive data via a **broker**. | Lightweight, low bandwidth, reliable delivery (QoS). | Home automation, sensor networks, real-time monitoring. |
| **HTTP** | *HyperText Transfer Protocol* | **Request/Response model** — client sends a request and waits for a response. | Simple, widely supported, higher data overhead. | Cloud dashboards, REST APIs, web integration. |
| **CoAP** | *Constrained Application Protocol* | Designed for constrained devices using **UDP** instead of TCP. | Low overhead, asynchronous, suitable for small sensors. | Smart energy, industrial IoT, embedded networks. |
| **AMQP** | *Advanced Message Queuing Protocol* | Uses **message brokers** to ensure reliable queuing and delivery. | Secure, transactional, supports queue-based communication. | Enterprise IoT, financial, and industrial systems. |
| **WebSocket** | — | Provides **full-duplex communication** between client and server. | Real-time, low-latency, interactive communication. | Live dashboards, chat systems, real-time IoT apps. |

## 🧩 Four Layers of IoT Architecture

| 🏗️ Layer | 📋 Description | 🔧 Example Components |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **1. Perception Layer (Things Layer)** | Detects or measures physical parameters such as temperature, pressure, or motion. | Sensors, actuators |
| **2. Network Layer (Connectivity Layer)** | Transfers data between devices and systems using communication technologies. | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 4G/5G |
| **3. Middleware Layer (Processing Layer)** | Processes, stores, and manages the data; handles decision-making. | Microcontrollers, Edge processors |
| **4. Application Layer (User Layer)** | Provides interfaces for users to interact, monitor, and control IoT systems. | Dashboards, mobile apps, web portals |

```

📘 **Explanation:**
1. **Sensors** collect environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity).  
2. **Microcontroller** processes and routes the data.  
3. **Cloud** stores and analyzes data for further use.  
4. **User** monitors and controls the system via a device or app.  
5. **Actuator** performs the required action based on processed data or user commands.
